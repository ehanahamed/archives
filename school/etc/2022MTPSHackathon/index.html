          What is <span class="special">ocean pullution</span>?
        </div>
        <div class="text regular left">
          Ocean pullution is when substances created or used by humans, such as
          waste, particles, plastic, or excess gasses enter the ocean. Plastic
          particles and other substances may end up in the ocean as a result of
          littering or improper garbage disposal techniques. Plastic particles
          are small enough to be accidentally consumed by ocean animals such as
          fish or sharks who may choke on such objects. Toxic chemicals that are
          put into the ocean kill marine life, which harms the overall
          ecosystem.

          How <span class="special">dangerous</span> is it?
        </div>
        <div class="text regular right">
          Even though plastic trash is extremly harmful to the ecosystem,
          invisible particles and chemicals are often more dangerous than the
          more visible pollutants. These chemicals not only harm ocean life but
          also harm creatures that depend on products from the ocean, such as us
          humans. Many everyday products such as salt, and seafood come from
          oceans. However, pullution is rapidly making these products toxic.
          Scientists estimate that by 2050 there will be more trash and
          chemicals in the oceans than fish and other marine life. Ocean
          pullution is not the only factor causing harm to the seas, overfishing
          is also exremly harmful to marine life and those who depend on it.

          How can <span class="special">you</span> help?
        </div>
        <div class="text regular middle">
          <span class="special bold">Recycling</span> helps prevent more plastic
          from entering the ocean, always recycle plastic, paper, and metal
          products when possible! Make sure you recycle the different matierals
          in the correct bins and do not mix different matierals. <br /><br />
          <span class="special bold">Donating</span> to advocacy organizations
          that help pass laws to prevent pollution, such as
          <a href="https://oceana.org/" class="special bold">Oceana</a>, helps
          prevent more pollution. Donating to organizations that physically
          clean trash and other polutants out of the ocean, such as
          <a href="https://teamseas.org/" class="special bold">#TeamSeas</a>,
          helps undo some of the damage already done to the ocean. <br />
          <br />
          <span class="special bold">Educating</span> others on what ocean
          pullution is, how it's effects are consequential worldwide, and how to
          help prevent it, can help others prevent ocean pullution too!
