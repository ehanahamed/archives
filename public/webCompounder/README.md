<br>
<h2>üì¶ Installation </h2>

You can install webCompounder from npm, like any other npm package.

```shell
> npm install webcompounder --save-dev
```

You should _probably_ install it as a developer dependency, using the `--save-dev` flag. (Unless you have a reason not to, of course.)

Unlike some npm packages, webCompounder does **not** need to be installed globally to work. (It will only work within the folder it's installed into, though. But in most cases thats all you need.)

<br>
<h2>üîß Command-Line Usage</h2>

webCompounder doesn't use a lot of flags or command line arguements, instead you set the options in a configuration file.

If you have different workflows with different options, you can have multiple configuration files, and can run configuration file one at a time.

Then you put the path to the configuration file as an arguement in the command.

```shell
> webCompounder ./pathTo/configFile.json
```

<br>
<h2>üìã Configuration Files</h2>

Configuration files are JSON files with a workflow value, an input value, and an output value.

The configuration file can have any filename and can be in any folder, but must be a json file and can **not** be outside of the root folder.

Here's an example:

```json
{
  "workflow": "bundle",
  "input": [
    "./pathTo/file.extension",
    "./pathTo/aFolder/",
    "./globsAre/**/alsoSupported/*.cool"
    "./yetAnother.extension"
  ],
  "output": "./pathToOutputFile/outputFile.extension"
}
```

Here's another, more _real-world_ example:

```json
{
   "workflow": "bundle",
   "input": ["./src/utils/colors.js", "./src/utils/utils.js", "./src/main.js"],
   "output": "./build/main.build.js"
}
```

The input value is an array, and each string in the array is a file path to the files you want to merge together.

The output value is a single string, and is a file path pointing to the file that all the other files will combine into.

_All_ the file paths are relative to the **root** folder, where `package.json` is and where your terminal/shell session is, _even_ if the configuration file is **not** in the root folder, paths are **still** relative to the root folder!

<br>
<h2>üìÅ In-Depth Usage Example </h2>

**Installation:** `./`

```shell
> npm install webcompounder --save-dev
```

<br>

Input File: `./src/utils/colors.js`

**This file's code does not matter, its just an example of a file that will be combined.**

```javascript
var colors = {
   red: "#ff0000",
   orange: "#ff5500",
   yellow: "#ffff00",
   green: "#00ff00",
   blue: "#0000ff",
   purple: "#ff00ff",
   white: "#ffffff",
   gray: "#555555",
   black: "#000000"
};
```

<br>

**Input File:** `./src/utils/utils.js`

**This file's code does not matter, its just an example of a file that will be combined.**

```javascript
var utils = {
   colors: colors
};
```

<br>

Input File: `./src/main.js`

**This file's code does not matter, its just an example of a file that will be combined.**

```javascript
var someLibrary = {
   utils: utils
};
```

<br>

**Configuration File:** `./build/config/buildJs.json`

```json
{
   "workflow": "bundle",
   "input": ["./src/utils/colors.js", "./src/utils/utils.js", "./src/main.js"],
   "output": "./build/main.build.js"
}
```

**Notice how even though the configuration file is in `./build/config/`, the paths are relative to `./`. This is because `./` is where webCompounder was installed into.**

<br>

**Terminal/Shell:** `./`

```shell
> webCompounder -v
v1.1.6
> webCompounder ./build/config/buildJs.json
Sucessfully loaded config file!

Sucessfully bundled files!
Process Complete!
```

**You can run `webCompounder -v` or `webCompounder --version` to check the version of webCompounder that's installed. This also helps test if webCompounder is working.**

<br>

Output File: `./build/main.build.js`

**This file's code does not matter, its just an example of a file that was generated.**

```javascript
var colors = {
   red: "#ff0000",
   orange: "#ff5500",
   yellow: "#ffff00",
   green: "#00ff00",
   blue: "#0000ff",
   purple: "#ff00ff",
   white: "#ffffff",
   gray: "#555555",
   black: "#000000"
};

var utils = {
   colors: colors
};

var someLibrary = {
   utils: utils
};
```
